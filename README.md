# dataquest-NYC-school-perceptions
*This is a Guided Project I completed for the Data Analyst/Data Science path on Dataquest. Dataquest does provide solution code that is available while completing this project. As a result, I do not claim that all of this code is mine or original. At times when I got stuck or when my code didn't fit the direction of the guided analysis, I matched their code for the sake of completing the exercise and learning the structure of the analysis. So while the code is not 100% original or unique, I believe one of the strengths of these projects is that it helps students like me identify business problems where analysis like this can be valuable. As a result, I'm confident that I can adapt this particular analysis to similar business problems I may face in my day-to-day work.*

## Introduction
In this project, we'll be analyzing data from NYC school surveys of parents, teachers, and students to understand how each audience perceives NYC schools.

Questions we will consider include:
- Do student, teacher, and parent perceptions of NYC school quality appear to be related to demographic and academic success metrics?
- Do students, teachers, and parents have similar perceptions of NYC school quality?

### Methods Used
- exploratory data analysis
- correlation matrix

### Technologies Used
- R
    - tidyr
    - dplyr
    - readr
    - stringr
    - purrr
    - ggplot2

## For further analysis
- Is there a relationship between gender percentages and average SAT scores? How about for the different sections of the SAT (Reading, Writing, and Math)?

- Which NYC schools seem to have the best quality metrics according to survey data? Is there a difference if you break this down by response type?

- Can you learn anything from the differences in school quality metric perception between groups? For example, if you created a new variable by subtracting saf_p_11 from saf_p_11, do you think this difference in how students and parents perceive safety may be related to any other variables?
